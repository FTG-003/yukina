# 🎉 New Chatbot Live! Trained on Pyragogy Docs + Thanks to Anything-LLM 

Hello everyone!

We're excited to announce a big update to our ecosystem:  
we've just integrated a **chatbot trained on the official Pyragogy documentation** 📚🤖

It's still in beta, but already capable of answering questions, helping with doubts, and navigating our content like a truly tireless study companion.  
One small step closer to intelligent, continuous access to our shared knowledge.

👉 All of this was made possible thanks to an **amazing open-source project**:  
[**Anything-LLM**](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm) by Mintplex Labs.  

A lightweight, well-documented, and incredibly versatile framework. We **highly recommend trying it out** (and if you can, support it!).  
It's one of those tools that really make a difference when you want AI to be useful, accessible, and community-driven.

Let us know what you think, test the chatbot, and feel free to explore the Anything-LLM repo on GitHub.  
It truly deserves all the stars ⭐

Pyragogically yours,  
– The Team
