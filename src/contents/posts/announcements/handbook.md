## Pyragogy Launches Its First Automation for Handbook Creation

*Bergamo, Italy — August 10, 2025* — Pyragogy has taken its first practical step in improving group learning by launching an **n8n automation** to create the *Pyragogy Handbook*. This isn’t about changing the world—just about making our collective way of learning a bit smoother.  
Check out our **free** workflow here: [n8n workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/4904-pyragogy-ai-driven-handbook-generator-with-multi-agent-orchestration/).

## How the AI Agents Worked Together

The task was simple but meaningful: produce the handbook’s first draft in **Italian** using several AI Agents, each with its own prompt and workflow. The process looked less like a tidy orchestra and more like a lively jam session—sometimes chaotic, but always moving forward.

One standout moment: Gemini 2.5 refused to work without a decent knowledge base. So it went off on its own, digging through 68 websites to get a grip on Pyragogy before answering. That kind of initiative made the whole process more solid.

## What’s Next? From Draft to Real Collaboration

The automation spit out a single file, which we saved automatically on Pyragogy’s GitHub: [Introduction](https://github.com/pyragogy/pyragogy-hanbook/blob/main/Introduzione).

Then we imported it into the [Pyragogy Wiki](https://wikijs.pyragogy.org/it/home), where it’s ready for everyone to edit and improve together. For now, it’s all in Italian, keeping it authentic to the first version.

**A quick heads-up:** This first draft was made with a pretty limited knowledge base. Going forward, when we focus on single chapters, we’ll use conversations between members and our internal [LLM workspace](https://any.pyragogy.org/) as metadata references.

So here’s the deal: if you’re part of the community, start throwing in your ideas and questions. The more discussion we have, the better the knowledge base will be — and the stronger the next versions will become.

Let’s keep it real and keep learning together.

**Rock’n Roll!**
