# Great News on Pyragogy.org: CodiMD Has Arrived!

We are thrilled to announce the integration of **CodiMD** on the Pyragogy.org platform! This new feature will revolutionize the way we collaborate and create content together.

CodiMD is a real-time collaborative Markdown editor that will allow you to:

*   **Write and edit documents** simply and intuitively, using Markdown syntax.
*   **Collaborate in real-time** with other group members, seeing changes as they are made.
*   **Easily share** notes, ideas, and projects within our community.

You can find a complete guide to the Markdown syntax supported by CodiMD here: [CodiMD Markdown Syntax](https://hackmd.io/c/codimd-documentation/%2F%40codimd%2Fmarkdown-syntax)

This integration is a fundamental step in our continuous commitment to creating the **best possible learning environment** for all Pyragogy.org members. We will continue to work to provide you with increasingly powerful and intuitive tools for your growth and collaboration.

Stay tuned for more updates and new features!

The Pyragogy.org Team
