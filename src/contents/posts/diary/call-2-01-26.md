# Why Pyragogy Is Not (Only) a Tool for Thought

Over the past few days, we slowed down.

Not because ideas, calls, or opportunities were lacking.  
But because one of them — quietly — forced us to stop and listen.

It is the **“Tools for Thought with Generative AI” workshop (CHI EA 2026)**:  
a solid, well-argued proposal that attempts to shift the conversation around generative AI from productivity to thinking, from outputs to cognitive processes.

We are not mentioning it here to say *“we are participating.”*  
We mention it because **it concerns us**.

## Where We Recognize Ourselves

The idea of [Tools for Thought](https://www.rheingold.com/texts/tft/) is grounded in an intuition we deeply share:  
AI should not be evaluated only by what it produces, but by **how it reshapes the way we think**.

Doing more is not enough.  
What matters is thinking better.

In this sense, many elements of the call resonate strongly with Pyragogy:

- a focus on process rather than outcome  
- a critique of AI as a cognitive “autopilot”  
- the centrality of metacognition  
- skepticism toward productivity that erodes learning and agency  

When AI skips all intermediate steps, it does not help us think.  
It replaces us.

## Where We Sense a Gap

And yet, while reading the call, we felt a gap.

Not a mistake.  
A structural absence.

There is much talk of tools, strategies, and adoption.  
Of design and evaluation.  
But very little about **time**.

Not task time.  
Thinking time.

Not the event, the experiment, the workshop.  
But the daily rhythm through which a person thinks, gets confused, returns, and learns.

Pyragogy starts here:

- thinking has a rhythm  
- learning is not linear  
- friction is not always a flaw  
- slowness can be a cognitive function  

A system that “works” but ignores the inner tempo of the person using it  
will eventually break.

## Why Pyragogy Is Not (Only) a Tool for Thought

Pyragogy did not begin as a tool.

It began as:

- a learning system  
- a set of practices  
- a cognitive pact between humans and AI  
- a way of inhabiting thought, not just supporting it  

Tools matter.  
But they are not the center.

The center is:

- intentionality  
- rhythm  
- relationship  
- continuity over time  

In this sense, Pyragogy does not reject the idea of *Tools for Thought*.  
It moves through it.  
And attempts to go one step further.

## Our Strategy (for you)

We could respond to this call with a submission.  
Maybe we will. Maybe we won’t.

For now, we have chosen a different path.

To treat this call as an **open pyragogical task**.  
An object of thought, not a deadline.  
An opportunity for clarification, not exposure.

We want to understand — without haste:

- if and how Pyragogy can genuinely dialogue with this field  
- what we could bring without translating ourselves into something else  
- what we might lose by entering too early

## An Invitation (to a Few)

If you are reading Pyragogy, you are probably not looking for:

- a framework to apply  
- an AI that gives better answers  
- a ready-made method  

If instead you are interested in:

- thinking with AI as a cognitive ally, not a shortcut  
- exploring rhythm, friction, and continuity  
- building a response that **may never be submitted**, but is worth thinking through  

then this is an invitation.

Not to participate in a call.  
But to **think it together**.

## Logbook Note

Writing this text was not a linear act.

It comes after months of building, attempting, returning.  
After many conversations in which Pyragogy took shape without ever fully closing.

At this moment, we do not have a clear direction to declare.  
We do not know whether we will respond to this call.  
We do not know what the next “right” step will be.

But we do know one thing:  
we do not want to rush into occupying a space we do not yet feel as our own.

Pyragogy was not born from a strategy.  
It was born from friction.

And perhaps today, the most coherent gesture is precisely this:  
to stay with the question a little longer,  
rather than rushing toward an answer.

If you are reading this note and recognize yourself in this suspension,  
perhaps you are not here to find a direction.

Perhaps you are here to **learn how to remain inside it**.
