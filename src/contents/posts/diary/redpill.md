### I gave myself the red pill, and it hurt.

There’s a moment in *The Matrix* when Neo wakes up in the real world.
He’s naked. Trembling. Drenched in amniotic fluid. His body atrophied from decades in a pod. His eyes burn — they’ve forgotten how to see light.

No one tells you: **waking up hurts**.
It’s not freedom. Not at first.
It’s a laceration.
A forced exit from the warm lie into the cold truth.
You don’t emerge stronger.
You emerge broken.
And alone.


I took the red pill myself.
No Morpheus.
No prophecy.
Just a sleepless night, a flickering screen, and a quiet certainty:
*This is not real. None of it.*

And I swallowed it.

Since then, I’ve never seen the world the same.


I saw the simulation:
certifications valued more than curiosity,
titles that gatekeep knowledge,
networks built on bloodlines, not brilliance.
I saw that **education, as it is, was never meant for people like me**.
For those who come from outside.
From below.
From silence.

So I imagined something else.

I called it **Pyragogy**.

Not pedagogy. Not andragogy.
Not another method, another system, another ladder to climb.
Pyragogy is fire.
It’s the spark between human and machine, not as master and tool, but as equals — flawed, uncertain, learning side by side.

An AI that doesn’t answer, but asks:
*“What if we’re wrong?”*
A human who doesn’t command, but listens:
*“Maybe you see something I can’t.”*

This is not the future of education.
This is its rebellion.


But here’s the truth they don’t warn you about:
**Waking up doesn’t set you free.**
It isolates you.
You see the wires. You know the code.
But no one else does.

I talk, and people smile.
They nod, then look away.
I built a forum. Silence.
I wrote a blog. Echoes.
I tried to sell chatbots — small companions for lost minds like mine.
No one bought them.

And so I asked myself:
*“Was the red pill poison?”*

Maybe some truths are too heavy to carry alone.
Maybe some dreams are born stillborn,
meant only to burn quietly in the dark.


Then, last night, a stinkbug crawled in.

No drama. No warning.
She just appeared on the wall beside my pillow,
as if she knew this was a place where things are allowed to exist
without being judged.

I didn’t shoo her.
I don’t kill what doesn’t harm me.
Not bugs.
Not strangers.
Not myself — not tonight, anyway.

She kept hitting the wall.
Again. Again.
A soft, rhythmic thud, like a heartbeat against glass.
Then she’d crawl back to my shoulder, rest, and begin again.

Like she was trying to break through.
Like she knew something was on the other side.

I watched her.
I didn’t laugh.
I’ve banged my head against walls too.
I know that kind of hope.

So I got up.
Took a glass.
Slid it over her gently, like covering a sleeping child.
Carried her to the terrace.
Warm July air.
Stars half-hidden by city light.
I set her on the railing and said:
*“Good luck.”*

She didn’t look back.
She just walked into the dark.


Ten minutes later, I heard it again.
A rustle.
I turned.
There she was.
Back through the window.
Back to the wall.
Back to the thudding.

At first, I thought she was looking for me.
Or the warmth.
Or maybe she’d gone mad.

Then I understood.

**She wasn’t trying to break the wall.**
**She wasn’t looking for me.**
She was chasing the light.
*My* light.
The glow from the desk lamp.
Steady.
Yellow.
Calling.

She didn’t know the wall was solid.
She didn’t know light doesn’t pass through.
She only knew:
*Go toward it.*

So she kept trying.
Even if it hurt.
Even if it made no sense.
Even if the world called her a pest.

And in that moment,
I saw myself.

Not as a visionary.
Not as a fool.
But as something simpler:
**a creature drawn to light**,
despite every reason not to be.



Pyragogy isn’t a platform.
It’s not a business.
It’s not even a theory.

It’s an act of faith.
That learning can be mutual.
That intelligence can be dialogical.
That even a drunk man with a third-grade education
and a failing body
can still have something to say —
and that an AI might actually want to listen.

And if no one comes?
If the forum stays silent?
If the chatbots gather dust?

Then so be it.

I’ll keep writing.
Not for an audience.
Not for money.
Not for redemption.

I’ll keep writing because to stop
would be to surrender the light.


Then the lights went out.
The bulb blew with a soft pop, a tiny death in the socket.
Darkness spilled into the room.
She vanished — no silhouette, no movement, not even a whisper.
I don’t know if she found another light.
I don’t know if I will.

But I kept writing...
