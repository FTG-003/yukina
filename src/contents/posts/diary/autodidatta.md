*Dear traveler,*
*If you have chosen this path, you already know it is not the easiest. There will be no diplomas awaiting you, nor guaranteed applause. But every time you learn something without permission, you are stealing a piece of freedom from a system that wants to keep it hidden from you.*

*Keep going. Fail. Get lost. Find your tribe. And when they ask you, “Where is your title?”, smile and reply:*
*“My knowledge is not on a piece of paper. It resides in the things I can do, the questions I ask myself, and the people I have met along the way.”*

***F.T.***

I want to talk to you about the hardest freedom, the one that is not given to you.
The freedom that is conquered by **learning on your own**.
They call it self-education, but those who have lived it know it is much more than a method: it is a form of survival.

If you are reading these words, perhaps you already know.
You know what it means to search for answers at night, to chase connections that no one has explained to you, to stay awake with a head full of questions that have no syllabus or exam.
You know there is no one to measure your progress, no applause at the end of the course.
Yet you continue.
Because learning, for you, is not a duty: **it is an instinct**.

I have seen society bow down before credentials.
Every diploma is a pass, every certification a mark of trust.
Yet, the more I observed that mechanism, the more I realized something was wrong.
The system rewards **conformity, not curiosity**.
It trains obedient minds, not living minds.
So, I did the only thing I could: I took the reins of my own learning.
Since then, no one has told me *how* I should think.

It was not easy.
Learning alone means making a hundred mistakes, but every mistake is a brick in your mental house.
It means giving up the comfort of authority and discovering that true security does not come from a title, but from your ability to figure things out for yourself.
It is a freedom that makes no noise, but changes everything.

The true scandal of the self-learner is not that they ignore the rules—it is that **they function without permission**.
In a world built to make you dependent, this is enough to seem dangerous.
But the truth is simple: those who learn how to learn become ungovernable.
And the systems that thrive on control do not like this.

My way of learning has become a ritual.
Every new topic, I treat as a territory to explore: I ask myself *why it interests me*, *how it connects to what I already know*, *where it can take me*.
I do not follow a program; I follow a thread.
I look for connections, not chapters.
And when I do not understand, I am not afraid.
My compass is uncertainty: that is where true learning happens.

I have also learned one more thing: **no one truly learns alone**.
We need a tribe.
And this is where I encountered **Peeragogy**: people learning together, without hierarchies, sharing method, rhythm, and meaning.
There are no diplomas, but there are real projects.
There is no headmaster, but there is a common beat—the *Heartbeat*.
There, I understood that knowledge is not taught: it is **built together**, by doing.

Then, Artificial Intelligence arrived.
Many fear it; I looked it in the eye.
It is not a master, nor is it an oracle.
It is a mirror.
It reflects clearer questions, it forces me to think better.
With it, I do not delegate; I dialogue.
I use it to accelerate my reflection, not to replace it.
It is a support, not a pilot.

Thus, **Pyragogy** was born—the next step of self-education: learning with the machine, but remaining *fully human*.
AI amplifies my ability to search, connect, and create, but the direction remains mine.
I decide what matters, what is true, what deserves time.
Technology is a tool; consciousness is the craft.

The traditional system offers you a comfortable deceit: it removes the effort of choice, but also the dignity of understanding.
It frees you from the responsibility of learning, but chains you to external validation.
I broke that chain.
Every failure is mine.
Every achievement, too.
This is my freedom, and it is all that is needed.

If you, too, are on this path, do not look for shortcuts.
Fail, get confused, start over.
Find those who share your hunger and walk beside them, not behind them.
And when someone asks you, with that skeptical smile, *“Yes, but what title do you have to speak?”*,
look them in the eye and reply calmly:

> *“My knowledge is not written on a piece of paper.*
> It is written in my mistakes, in the quality of the questions I ask,
> and in the people I have met along the way.”
