## Learning Without Asking Permission
*Dear Pyragogues,*
*If you have chosen this path, you already know it is not the easiest. There will be no diplomas awaiting you, nor guaranteed applause. But every time you learn something without permission, you are stealing a piece of freedom from a system that wants to keep it hidden from you.*

*Keep going. Fail. Get lost. Find your tribe. And when they ask you, “Where is your title?”, smile and reply:*
*“My knowledge is not on a piece of paper. It resides in the things I can do, the questions I ask myself, and the people I have met along the way.”*

***F.T.***

If you’re reading these words, you probably already know.  
You know what it means to stay up until three in the morning not because you have to,  
but because you followed a thread and can’t let it go.  
No one asked you to. No one will grade you.  
But you keep going, because in that moment learning isn’t a duty — it’s hunger.

And that’s the only thing that truly matters: **hunger.**

## The System Wants You Full

Let me say something unpopular: the educational system isn’t evil.  
It’s worse. It’s efficient.

It has to take thousands of people and move them all from A to B.  
It has to certify, standardize, guarantee.  
And to do that, it must make you predictable.  
It must silence your hunger and replace it with programs, exams, and  
*"this is what you need to know."*

The problem isn’t that it teaches you the wrong things.  
The problem is that it teaches you to **stop searching.**

I’ve seen brilliant minds become obedient.  
Not stupid — obedient.  
Able to solve problems in the proper format,  
but unable to ask whether those problems are even worth solving.

The system offers you a deal:  
> “Follow me and you’ll be safe.  
> You’ll get a diploma, a certificate, a proof that you can do what you say you can do.”  

It’s a fair deal, for many.  
But there’s a hidden price: **you give up deciding what is worth knowing.**

## The Freedom No One Gives You

I chose the other path.  
Not because it’s better — just because it’s mine.

Every mistake I make is mine.  
Every dead end, every month lost chasing something that turned out useless,  
every time I have to admit *“I don’t know”* — all mine.  
But also every spark, every connection no syllabus would have ever shown me.  
Every moment when I truly understand something — not because I memorized it,  
but because I earned it.

That’s my freedom: **total responsibility.**

There’s no one to blame.  
No one to ask permission from.  
No one to tell me if I’m going in the right direction — because I decide what “right” means.

It sounds heroic, but it’s frightening.  
Every morning you wake up and ask: *what deserves my attention today?*  
And what if I’m wrong? What if I’m wasting time?

You do it anyway.  
Because the alternative — letting someone else decide for you — is even scarier.

## Artificial Intelligence Is Not the Teacher

Many people see AI and think: “Finally, a teacher available 24/7.”  
They’re wrong.

AI is not a teacher.  
It’s a mirror that shows how precise your questions really are.  
It’s an amplifier that makes your skills faster, but not deeper.  
It’s a library that answers, but doesn’t know what you *should* be looking for.

I use it every day.  
But I know it’s a prosthesis, not a brain.  
It accelerates, I choose.  
It suggests, I verify.  
It answers, I understand.

The greatest danger isn’t that AI gives you wrong answers.  
It’s that it gives you *right* answers so fast you forget the struggle that makes them yours —  
the struggle that turns information into understanding.

AI is a tool for those who already know how to use their own minds.  
For everyone else, it’s just a more sophisticated way to stay on the surface.

## You Don’t Learn Alone

Here’s the truth the romantic autodidacts won’t tell you: **you never really learn alone.**

You need a tribe.  
Not teachers, not students — accomplices.  
People on the same journey, who ask questions you wouldn’t think to ask,  
who see your blind spots, who share their failures without shame.

I found my tribe in *peer learning* — call it *Pyragogy*, call it a community, whatever.  
The name doesn’t matter. What matters is this: we learn together, but no one commands.  
Rules emerge from doing, not from authority.  
Projects are real, not exercises.  
Evaluation is brutal: it works, or it doesn’t.

When you find these people, everything changes.  
You’re no longer alone with your doubts.  
But you’re not protected either: they challenge you,  
call you out when you’re cheating yourself, and make you better.

## The Question That Changes Everything

When someone asks me, with that skeptical smile,  
*“Yeah, but what’s your title?”* —  
I could get angry. I could preach about the limits of credentials.  

Instead, I answer with a question:  
> “Can I actually do what I say I can do?”  

That’s the only honest question. Everything else is theater.

Diplomas certify that you’ve followed a path — fine.  
In many fields, they’re necessary and right.  
But they don’t tell me if you can think, if you can learn something new when you need to,  
if you can build something that didn’t exist before.

My knowledge isn’t written on a piece of paper.  
It’s written in the projects I’ve built, the problems I’ve solved,  
the people I’ve worked with.  
It’s written in the mistakes I’ve made and the lessons I’ve kept.

It’s not better than certified knowledge.  
It’s just **harder to fake.**

## An Uncomfortable Invitation

If you feel this hunger — if you recognize yourself in these words —  
I’m not telling you to quit everything and become an autodidact.  
I’m just saying: **you can choose.**

You can choose not to wait for permission to learn something.  
You can choose to follow a thread just because it burns inside you.  
You can choose to build something before you’re “certified” to do it.

And yes, you’ll make mistakes. You’ll get lost. You’ll doubt yourself.  
But you’ll learn the one skill no system can teach:  
**how to find your way when there’s no one left to tell you where to go.**

The hardest freedom isn’t doing what you want.  
It’s *wanting what you do enough to pay the price.*
