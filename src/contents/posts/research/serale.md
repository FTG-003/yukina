# Rethinking Adult Evening Education in Italy — And Why It Matters Now for me

In 2026, I will dedicate my research and design work to one concrete mission: **transforming the real experience of adult evening education in Italy**, starting with the 👉 [CPIA – Italian Ministry of Education Overview](https://www.mim.gov.it/i-centri-provinciali-per-l-istruzione-degli-adulti) system and second-level adult programs.

After years of observing these pathways from within — classrooms, faculty rooms, administrative offices, student interviews — one fact is impossible to ignore:

**The current model does not meet the real needs of adults who work all day, raise children, and study at night.**

We see it everywhere:

- High dropout rates  
- Rigid programs disconnected from the lived experience of adult learners  
- Enormous public and personal effort with limited return  
- A system designed for students who are no longer students  

This is not a minor issue.  
It is a **structural misalignment** between what adult learners need and what institutions can realistically offer.

## 🎯 Project Goal

This research–action project (January 2026 → March 2027) has one clear objective:

**To design, empirically validate, and openly document a pyragogical format for adult evening secondary education in Italy.**

A format that is:

- **adult-centered**, valuing prior experience and competencies  
- **hybrid only when it adds real educational value**  
- **measurable** in terms of meaningful learning, retention, and learner well-being  
- **sustainable** for institutions and for teachers working in evening settings  

The aim is not theoretical reflection.  
The aim is a **replicable, evidence-informed model** that improves learning and reduces dropout.

## 🔧 Project Structure (2026–2027)

### **T1 — January–March 2026**
Root-cause analysis:
- dropout data  
- interviews with learners and teachers  
- ethnographic observation inside CPIA and evening programs

### **T2 — April–June 2026**
Design of the **first pyragogical prototype** for adult evening education.

### **T3 — September–December 2026**
Field testing with **two real groups of adult workers** attending evening classes.

### **T4 — January–March 2027**
External evaluation and open-access publication of:

- the full model  
- practical guidelines  
- implementation materials  
- evidence and datasets

## 🧭 Why This Work Matters

Adult education is one of the least discussed yet most essential pillars of democratic societies.  
When adults succeed, families stabilise, workplaces improve, and communities become stronger.

But adult learners cannot — and should not — be treated like teenagers with evening schedules.

This project seeks to restore **realism, dignity, and pedagogical innovation** to a system that urgently needs them.

The final output will be a model that is:

- practical  
- affordable  
- grounded in everyday life  
- adaptable across different regions and contexts

## 🤝 Call for Collaboration

If you are:

- a CPIA director,  
- an evening school teacher,  
- a researcher in adult learning,  
- or a trainer interested in peer-driven or pyragogical approaches,

and you would like to contribute — through critique, participation, or field collaboration —  
**I’d be glad to connect.**

There is room for anyone who wants to move from diagnosis to **real solutions**.
