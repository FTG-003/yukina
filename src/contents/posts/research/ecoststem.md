## Eco-System: a new phonetic framework for Italian memory

For lovers of mnemonic systems, **Fabrizio Terzi** has just released on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17436054) a prototype of a *phonetic-mnemonic conversion framework* that adapts the classic **Major System** to Italian phonology and linguistic culture.  

The project, called **Eco-System**, is an experiment in *applied cognitive education*, rethinking the relationship between numbers, sounds, and verbal memory.  
Where traditional English-based systems struggle to resonate with Italian ears, Eco-System builds bridges — between sound and meaning, memory and culture, numbers and words.

> “It’s not just a system to remember numbers, but a way to think phonetically — to listen to language as a map of the mind.”  
> — *F.T.*

The publication is available in open access:

### Coming soon: the Eco Agent

A companion website is now live at [ecosystem.pyragogy.org](https://ecosystem.pyragogy.org/), where programming enthusiasts will soon be able to **experiment with building the Eco Agent** — an AI dedicated to phonetic and visual learning.  

The Eco Agent will be able to:
- generate and expand a **word database** linked to the phonetic and numerical structure of the system;  
- assist users in **creating mnemonic images**, turning numbers into vivid personalized representations.  

A playground for computational linguistics and visual imagination — where code meets memory, and learning becomes a shared act of creation.
